# Rholang IntelliJ IDEA language plugin

![beta][beta-badge]

This is the early stage of editor support for [Rholang][rho-github]. :smile:

For now, it has only support for syntax highlighting. I tried to make parser more forgiving so it can highlight wider range of correct programs. With more context information from compiler it could be much more precise.

> **Rholang** is a fully featured, general purpose, Turing-complete programming language built from the rho-calculus. It is a behaviorally typed, **r**-eflective, **h**-igher **o**-rder process language and the official smart contracting language of [RChain][rchain-coop]. Its purpose is to concretize fine-grained, programmatic concurrency. [RChain Architecture][arch-rholang]

Rholang is currently in active development and syntax can slightly change. Current version of plugin follows this version of [Rho grammar][rho-bnf-origin] and available examples.

I found interesting that many grammar rules have a strong gravity towards `Proc`ess :cyclone: but that should not be strange for π-calculus, _λ-expression_ is not the main _actor_ here. [Mobile process calculi for programming the new blockchain][tuplespaces-to-picalculus]

Programmers in concurrent languages such as Erlang/Elixir say that one of the hardest problems is to coordinate the names (locations) of processes. It seems that Rholang with [Namespace logic][arch-namespace-logic] looks like a great solution for coordination of resources.

With all this sweet superpowers, that comes with the Rholang compiler and type checker, it will be a pleasure to write smart contracts. :lollipop:

## Configure custom colors on the settings page

Only colors for _Constructor_ and _Bind parameter_ have no default values.

![Idea settings page](./docs/settings-page.png)

## Install

From [JetBrains Plugins Repository][rho-idea-plugin] searchable inside the editor.

Or download **rholang-idea.jar** from the [latest release][releases] and install through [File > Settings > Plugins][idea-install-from-disk] menu.

## [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Any feedback, suggestions, bugs, testing, pull-requests, issues are very welcome. :smile:

### Development

- setup [IntelliJ dev-plugin prerequisites][idea-dev-setup]
- open repo in the editor
- generate Java parser from `Rho.bnf` through the file context menu [Generate Parser Code][idea-gen-parser]
- generate Java lexer from `Rho.flex` through the file context menu [Run JFlex Generator][idea-gen-lexer]
- create new Plugin Run configuration with default setup
- run/debug in a separate editor

### Test

Intellij has provide some test frameworks.These framework do simplified verifying work. For more detail you can read [IntelliJ Platform SDK DevGuide
][idea-test-guide]

#### How to use

Just as using JUnit, there is a 'run' button on the left of the class or test case. You can click this button to run or debug. But there will be error after you run the test case, reporting that can not find the file. Now, you should config the run configuration, and set the vm option as follows:

```
-ea -Xbootclasspath/p:../out/classes/production/boot -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=320m -Didea.system.path=../test-system -Didea.home.path=./ -Didea.config.path=../test-config -Didea.test.group=ALL_EXCLUDE_DEFINED 
```

Then rerun the test case, and you'll find it works.

### Deployment

- generate _jar_ file through the project root context menu [Prepare Plugin Module ... For Deployment][idea-deploy]
- upload _jar_ to [JetBrains Plugins Repository][rho-idea-plugin] 

### TODO

- write Formatter
- write [Completion Contributor][idea-completion]
- write [Reference Contributor][idea-reference]
- add [plugin actions][idea-plugin-actions]
- connect with the compiler (get semantic info)
- ...
