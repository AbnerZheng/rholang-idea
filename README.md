# Rholang IntelliJ IDEA language plugin

![beta][beta-badge]

This is the early stage of editor support for [Rholang][rho-github]. :smile:

For now, it has only support for syntax highlighting. I tried to make parser more forgiving so it can highlight wider range of correct programs. With more context information from compiler it could be much more precise.

> **Rholang** is a fully featured, general purpose, Turing-complete programming language built from the rho-calculus. It is a behaviorally typed, **r**-eflective, **h**-igher **o**-rder process language and the official smart contracting language of [RChain][rchain-coop]. Its purpose is to concretize fine-grained, programmatic concurrency. [RChain Architecture][arch-rholang]

Rholang is currently in active development and syntax can slightly change. Current version of plugin follows this version of [Rho grammar][rho-bnf-origin] and available examples.

I found interesting that many grammar rules have a strong gravity towards `Proc`ess :cyclone: but that should not be strange for π-calculus, _λ-expression_ is not the main _actor_ here. [Mobile process calculi for programming the new blockchain][tuplespaces-to-picalculus]

Programmers in concurrent languages such as Erlang/Elixir say that one of the hardest problems is to coordinate the names (locations) of processes. It seems that Rholang with [Namespace logic][arch-namespace-logic] looks like a great solution for coordination of resources.

With all this sweet superpowers, that comes with the Rholang compiler and type checker, it will be a pleasure to write smart contracts. :lollipop:

## Configure custom colors on the settings page

Maybe you want to set color for _Bind parameter_ which has no default value.

![Idea settings page](./docs/settings-page.png)

## Install

From [JetBrains Plugins Repository][rho-idea-plugin] searchable inside the editor.

Or download **rholang-idea.jar** from the [latest release][releases] and install through [File > Settings > Plugins][idea-install-from-disk] menu.

## [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Any feedback, suggestions, bugs, testing, pull-requests, issues are very welcome. :smile:

### Development

- setup [IntelliJ dev-plugin prerequisites][idea-dev-setup]
- generate Java parser from `Rho.bnf` through the file context menu [Generate Parser Code][idea-gen-parser]
- generate Java lexer from `Rho.flex` through the file context menu [Run JFlex Generator][idea-gen-lexer] (choose _out_ folder or any folder outside the project where jflex.jar will be downloaded)
- build the project (choose _IntelliJ SDK_ and language level _8_)
- create new Plugin Run configuration with default setup
- run/debug in a separate editor
- optionally, to keep formatting consistent install plugin for [EditorConfig][editor-config]

### Test

IntelliJ has provided testing framework. This framework simplifies verification. For more details, you can read [IntelliJ Platform SDK DevGuide][idea-test-guide].

#### How to use

Just as using JUnit, there is a 'run' button on the left of the class or test case. You can click this button to run or debug. Also, _right-click_ on the `test` folder has option to _Run/Debug 'All Tests'_.

### Deployment

- generate _jar_ file through the project root context menu [Prepare Plugin Module ... For Deployment][idea-deploy] (in `.idea` folder)
- upload _jar_ to [JetBrains Plugins Repository][rho-idea-plugin] 

### TODO

- write more tests and configure CI
- write [Completion Contributor][idea-completion]
- write [Reference Contributor][idea-reference]
- add [plugin actions][idea-plugin-actions]
- connect with the compiler (get semantic info)
- ...
